# TM Splitter Utility

This is a simple utility for task splitting to reduce large datasets
into more manageble sizes. It is oriented towards generating a
MultiPolyon or Polygons which can then be be used by ogr2ogr or osmium
for making data extracts.

## Administrative Boundaries

The administrative boundary files are a MultiPolygon of every national
forest, park, or wilderness aea in the United States. Using the
__--split__ option creates a MultiPolygon of each region that can be
used to make data extracts using ogr2ogr or osmium. Each output file
has the name of the region as the filename.

## Grid Creation

Once the files for each region have been generated, they are still
large. Next a grid can be generated from each region as a
MultiPloygon. Each task in the grid is the maximum size supported to
create a Tasking Manager project, which is 5000square km.

# Task Creation

To create a file for making data extracts, the grid can be further
split into indivigual files for to use with ogr2ogr or osmium.
